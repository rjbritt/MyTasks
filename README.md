MyTasks is an Android app which allowed the user to create tasks with varying importance (Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty for example) and an assigned estimated time to complete. The user then marked when they began and ended a task.The app aggregated the data to display the statistics on the tasks and suggest whether or not the user should estimate more or less time on a task of a particular importance level.
